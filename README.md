## About

This program is simply writen in pure ANSI C without using any game engine or GUI framework but the way it calculates and renders frames is similar theirs I guess. Besides, I didn't use any fancy algorithm for ghosts to find the path to the player, a simple (probably stupid) algorithm I came up with while making it is used instead. [Let me know](https://github.com/mivinci/pm/issues) if you got better ideas :)
